<h1>The Magnus Opus</h1>

<h2>A Unified Framework for Time, Space, Energy, and Coherence</h2>

<p>
The Magnus Opus is a long-form body of work developed by Joshua Farrior,
integrating physics, geometry, systems theory, and coherence-based models
into a single architectural framework.
</p>

<p>
This is not a blog, a course, or a speculative manifesto.
It is a structured attempt to resolve fragmentation across modern physics
and engineering by re-examining foundational assumptions about time, space,
fields, and measurement.
</p>

<h2>What This Work Is</h2>

<p>
The Magnus Opus is a comprehensive framework that brings together
time-space and time-space inversion models,
coherence and field-based dynamics,
geometry as information storage and constraint,
energy flow, circulation, and collapse conditions,
and cross-domain synthesis across multiple branches of physics.
</p>

<p>
The work is architectural rather than incremental.
It focuses on structure, relationships, and constraints
instead of isolated equations or domain-specific tools.
</p>

<h2>Why It Exists</h2>

<p>
Modern physics is highly successful, but deeply fragmented.
Different branches describe reality using incompatible assumptions,
coordinate systems, and interpretations.
</p>

<p>
The Magnus Opus exists to address that fragmentation.
Its goal is not to replace existing physics,
but to provide a higher-order framework that explains
why different models work where they do,
and how they relate to one another through geometry,
coherence, and scale.
</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>
The Magnus Opus is an active and evolving work.
This site serves as the canonical reference point,
an authorship and timestamp anchor,
and the public landing page for the framework.
